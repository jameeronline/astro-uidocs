A well-defined color system is essential for creating a cohesive and accessible design. In our design system, colors are organized into primary, secondary, accent, and neutral palettes. Each palette serves a specific purpose, ensuring consistency across the product.

### Color Palettes

- **Primary Colors:** Used for main actions, highlights, and brand representation.
- **Secondary Colors:** Support the primary palette and provide variety.
- **Accent Colors:** Used sparingly to draw attention to important elements.
- **Neutral Colors:** Backgrounds, borders, and text colors for readability and balance.

### Tips for Choosing a Brand Color

- **Ensure Accessibility:** Check color contrast to make sure text is readable for everyone.
- **Be Consistent:** Use your brand color consistently across all platforms and materials.
- **Test in Context:** Preview your color choices in real UI scenarios to ensure they work well together.

By following these guidelines, you can create a visually appealing and accessible color system for your project.
